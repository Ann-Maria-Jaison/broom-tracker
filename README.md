# ðŸ§¹ Broom Tracker  

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project  
Broom Tracker is a simple web app designed for hostelers to **track the shared broom in real time**. It ensures that everyone knows **who is currently using the broom** and whether it is available in the designated storage location. The system also maintains a **history log** to improve accountability and avoid confusion.  

## ðŸ¤” Why I Created This  
As a hosteler, I often faced issues where my friends would come looking for the broom, only to find that it was already in use by someone else. My roommates and I also struggled to keep track of who took the broom last. To solve this problem, I built **Broom Tracker**, a real-time tracking system that ensures **efficient sharing and better coordination**.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
âœ… **Live status update** â€“ Displays who is currently using the broom.  
âœ… **Glassy UI** â€“ Modern black-themed design with animations.  
âœ… **History Log** â€“ Keeps a record of who took the broom and when.  
âœ… **GitHub-Powered Backend** â€“ Uses GitHub as a database to track the broom status.  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Glassmorphism design with animations), JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js(https://github.com/Ann-Maria-Jaison/broom-tracker-backend)
- **Database:** JSON file stored and updated via GitHub

4. The **real-time status** will update automatically.
